# Xzpyth mpv-config
## About
My personal config for MPV player with [SSSR](https://gist.github.com/igv/2364ffa6e81540f29cb7ab4c9bc05b6b) shader (i ditched FSCRNNX as it used 100% more resources than SSSR with adaptive sharpen). Next I use [Image viewer](https://github.com/occivink/mpv-image-viewer) with different upscale/dscale methods as it doesn't matter what FPS you will get and absolute perfection and sharpness was goal here
This config uses **gpu-api vulkan** and **vo=gpu-next** for HDR support
## Config
For images i use separate methods involving SSSR downscaling and FSCRNNX upscaling for hi-res and low-res images respectively
